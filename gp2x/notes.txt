Install

* Copy all the files from the archive to a directory of your SD card
* Copy the files "descent.hog" and "descent.pig" from your Descent CD to this directory as well
  (please note these files MUST be lowercase)
* Run d1x-rebirth_cockpit or d1x-rebirth_fullscreen to run the game
* See buttonmap.txt for a list of keys and combos


Notes

The game runs smoother in Cockpit-mode but you have also the choice to select a higher
cpu speed from the main menu. Be aware that this value will not be saved.

If you save a game please quit the game normally or your save state may be corrupted.

Please report any bugs to zicounixboard.de or the DXX-Forum found at http://www.dxx-rebirth.de.

Have fun :)
