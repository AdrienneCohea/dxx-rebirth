Known issues
------------
* On Windows the mouse is not correctly released if using ALT+TAB to minimize the game. This is not a bug in the program but rather the SDL library. It can be worked around by pausing the game and using ALT+ENTER to get the game to windowed mode. The mosue should not be stuck then anymore.
* Mac builds may suffer from crashes (or other random glitches) when playing MIDI music. This is not a bug in the program but rather an issue in timidity which SDL_mixer uses to play these files. Usingf a Soundtrack AddOn (which contains OGG files) should fix that problem.
