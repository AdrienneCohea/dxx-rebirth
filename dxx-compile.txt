This file describes how to compile D1X-Rebirth from source.

To compile you´ll need:

-gcc/g++
-mingw [windows]
-nasm (optional, for sdl-build)
-sdl
-scons


Building with SCons:
* open SConstruct and change D1XDATAPATH to specify where the DESCENT data files are located
* run "scons" with desired command-line options (see "scons -h" for complete list of options)
* place the binary wherever you want to have it
* copy your data files to the desired path you specified in "SConstruct" on D1XDATAPATH (see dxx-readme.txt for more information)


Building with make: [not supported anymore!!! Please use SCons or fix on your own :)]
* edit the "config" file and specify the output directory and the platform you´re running
* edit the appropriate "config.linux" "config.mingw" or "config.other" file to chenge the options
* run "make"
* place the binary wherever you want to have it
* copy your data files to the desired path you specified in "config" on DESCENT_DATA_PATH (see dxx-readme.txt for more information)
