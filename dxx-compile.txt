This file describes how to compile D2X-Rebirth from source.

D2X needs SDL, GLU (optionally) and PhysicsFS.
You can download PhysicsFS it from: http://icculus.org/physfs/ or http://www.dxx-rebirth.de

* run ./autogen.sh
* run ./configure. Use '--help' for more information and parameters.
* You also should use '--with-opengl' to compile the OpenGL build (recommended)
* also you can optinally appen '--with-sharepath=/path' (unix/linux only) to define the place for the descent2 data files
* additionally add '--disable-debug' and '--enable-release' to get rid of the debugging stuff
* x86_64 users should also use '--disable-fastfileio'.
* run "make"
* run "make install" (unix/linux only)
* copy your data files to the Sharepath

If you run into any problems do not hesitate to contact me.
