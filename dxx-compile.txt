This file describes how to compile D1X-Rebirth from source.

To compile you´ll need:

-gcc
-mingw under windows
-you don´t need msys but it´s supported anyway (just change the appropriate line in config.mingw)
-sdl under linux (development version)

* edit the "config" file and specify the output directory and the platform you´re running
* edit the appropriate "config.linux" "config.mingw" or "config.other" file to chenge the options
* run "make"
* the resulting file now will be copied in the directory you specified in "config"
* place the file wherever you want to have it
* copy your data files to the desired path (see DXX-README.TXT for more information)
