This file describes how to compile D2X-Rebirth from source.

-gcc/g++
-mingw [windows]
-nasm (optional, for sdl-build)
-sdl(-devel)
-GLU/GL
-scons (recommended)
-PhysFS

Building with SCons:
* run "scons" with desired command-line options (see "scons -h" for complete list of options)
* you may want to run "scons install" to install the binary after it's build
* copy your data files to the SHAREPATH (default: /usr/local/share/games/d2x-rebirth)


Building with make:
* run ./autogen.sh
* run ./configure. Use '--help' for more information and parameters.
* You also should use '--with-opengl' to compile the OpenGL build (recommended)
* also you can optinally appen '--with-sharepath=/path' (unix/linux only) to define the place for the descent2 data files
* additionally add '--disable-debug' and '--enable-release' to get rid of the debugging stuff
* x86_64 users should also use '--disable-fastfileio'.
* run "make"
* run "make install" (unix/linux only)
* copy your data files to the Sharepath
