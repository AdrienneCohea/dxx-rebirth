0. Introduction

This version of D1X is based on livnaâ€™s release of d1x-1.43.

I spend much time to improve the Sourcecode, tried to fix bugs in there and added some improvements. It is the goal of DXX-Rebirth to keep these games alive and the result is a very stable version of the Descent I port - called D1X-Rebrith.

I hope you enjoy the game as you did when you played it the first time.

2. Installation

See INSTALL.txt.


3. Multiplayer

D1X-Rebirth supports Multiplayer over (obsoleted) IPX and UDP/IP.
Please note that UDP/IP generally supports more features of D1X-Rebirth and uses Packet Loss Prevention while IPX is mainly meant to play together with non-D1X-Rebirth games.
Using UDP/IP works over LAN and Internet. By default, each game communicates over UDP-Port 42424. This can be changed via the menus while creating a game and manually join a game, command-line argument or D1X.INI. To successfully host a game online, make sure UDP-Port 42424 (or otherwise if specified correctly) is opened on your Router/Firewall. Clients do not need to open any ports.
The game also supports IPv6 if built in while compiling and should be backwards compatible to IPv4 builds as good as possible.
