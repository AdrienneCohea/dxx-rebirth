0. Introduction

This version of D1X is based on livnaâ€™s release of d1x-1.43.

I spend much time to improve the Sourcecode, tried to fix bugs in there and added some improvements. It is the goal of DXX-Rebirth to keep these games alive and the result is a very stable version of the Descent I port - called D1X-Rebrith.

I hope you enjoy the game as you did when you played it the first time.
