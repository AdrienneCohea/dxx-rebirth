0. Introduction:
================

   D2X-Rebirth is based on a late D2X-CVS Source, coded and released by Bradley Bell and his team.
   I spend much time to improve the Sourcecode, tried to fix bugs in there and added some improvements.
   It is the goal of DXX-Rebirth to keep these games alive and the result is a very stable version of
   the Descent ][ port - called D2X-Rebirth.
   I hope you enjoy the game as you did when you played it the first time.
   If you have something to say about my release, feel free to contact me at zicodxx [at] yahoo [dot] de


1. Features:
============

   D2X-Rebirth has every little feature you already may know from the DOS Version 1.2 of Descent 2 and much more.

   For example:
   * High resoution Fonts and briefing screens
   * High resolutions with full Cockpit support
   * Support for ALL resolutions - including Widescreen formats
   * Joystick and Mouse support
   * Possibility to run AddOn levels
   * LAN- and Online-gaming support
   * Record and play demos
   * OpenGL functions and Eyecandy like Trilinear filtering, Transparency effects etc.
   * MP3/OGG/AIF/WAV Jukebox Support
   * everything else you know from DESCENT ][
   * ... and much more!


2. Installation:
================

   See INSTALL.txt.


3. Multiplayer:
===============

   D2X-Rebirth supports Multiplayer over (obsoleted) IPX and UDP/IP.
   Please note that UDP/IP generally supports more features of D2X-Rebirth and uses Packet Loss Prevention while
   IPX is mainly meant to play together with non-D2X-Rebirth games.
   Using UDP/IP works over LAN and Internet. By default, each game communicates over UDP-Port 42424. This can be
   changed via the menus while creating a game and manually join a game, command-line argument or D2X.INI. To
   successfully host a game online, make sure UDP-Port 42424 (or otherwise if specified correctly) is opened on
   your Router/Firewall. Clients do not need to open any ports.
   The game also supports IPv6 if built in while compiling and should be backwards compatible to IPv4 builds
   as good as possible.


4. Legal stuff:
